# Hirst Art Project

Welcome to Hirst Art Project! 
This project is inspired by the work of Damien Hirst, a renowned contemporary artist known for his unique and often provocative pieces. 
This project is part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Bootcamp, where I learned to create interactive applications using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Introduction

This project is a creative application built using Python's Turtle graphics library. It is inspired by Damien Hirst's famous "Spot Paintings," which feature rows of randomly colored circles. This project demonstrates basic concepts of programming, such as loops, functions, and event handling, in a visually engaging way.

## Background on Damien Hirst

Damien Hirst is a British artist and entrepreneur, and a prominent member of the group known as the Young British Artists (YBAs). Hirst dominated the art scene in the UK during the 1990s and is internationally known for his controversial and thought-provoking works. One of his most famous series is the "Spot Paintings," which consists of rows of randomly colored circles, representing pharmaceutical pills and exploring themes of life, death, and the human condition.

## Features

- Create art inspired by Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Uses Python's Turtle graphics library to create and display the artwork

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hirst-art-project.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hirst-art-project
    ```

4. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can install the Turtle library using:

    ```bash
    pip install PythonTurtle
    ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
python hirst_project.py
```

This will launch the Turtle graphics window, and you can start creating Hirst-inspired art immediately.

## Project Inspiration

This project was inspired by Damien Hirst's "Spot Paintings," which feature grids of randomly colored spots. The program generates a similar grid of spots using random colors, mimicking Hirst's iconic style.
