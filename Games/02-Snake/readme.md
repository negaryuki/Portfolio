## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game that involves navigating a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. 
This project was developed as part of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, specifically on Day 20. It showcases essential programming skills and concepts, particularly in game development using Python.

## Key Concepts Explored

Throughout this project, I delved into several crucial concepts, honing my coding skills:

- **Screen Setup and Creating a Snake Body**: Setting up the game screen and initializing the snake's body were the initial steps in creating a captivating gaming environment.
- **Animating the Snake Segments on Screen**: The heart of the game is in its animation. I ensured smooth movement and captivating visuals as the snake navigates the screen.
- **Create a Snake Class & Move to OOP**: The transition to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brought structure and clarity to the code. I created a Snake Class to encapsulate the game's logic and functionalities.
- **How to Control the Snake with a Keypress**: Making the game interactive is key. I implemented control mechanisms to allow players to guide the snake's path with keyboard inputs.
